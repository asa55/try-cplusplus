// This is the header file that contains the declarations of functions defined in the corresponding source file.
// 
// The header file is used to declare the functions and variables that are defined in the corresponding source file (basic.cpp in this case). This allows other source files to use the functions and variables without needing to know the implementation details.
// 
// In this header file, we declare the main function, which is defined in the basic.cpp file. This allows other source files to call the main function without needing to know its implementation.
// 
// The declarations in the header file typically include the function prototypes, class definitions
