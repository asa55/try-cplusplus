# try-cplusplus

This repository is a personal space for practicing C++, but it should work fine for anyone else who forks this repo.

## Getting Started

To try out the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Open the repository in GitHub Codespaces
2. Open a `.cpp` file and start coding

Note `gcc` is built into CodeSpaces, so you have everything you need to practice right here.
Questions? Ask Copilot, also pre-installed per the `.devcontainer.json` definition.

## More info for people here to learn

I wrote [this blog post](https://medium.com/@alexander.s.augenstein/how-i-passed-the-c-code-interview-in-3-weeks-a3e350214a01) on Medium a long time ago. It has some decent learning material but that exists still more for my ego than anything. There are better learning tools out there.

My general advice these days for new learners goes something like this...
There are better resources online highlighted by people who have been in the trenches a long time, and despite my first foray into C++ being half a lifetime ago, these people still are not me. Take some time to poke around on forums for recommendations from people who have been there before you, and also turn everything you do into a hands-on learning project. Experience is inevitable, of which I have plenty. But learning only happens when feedback is consistent, immediate, and unambiguous. And that's a key distinction. So if your goal is to get good, roll up your sleeves, write code not for its own sake but with the intention of solving problems, and get feedback from people (or in today's world, algorithms) that know their stuff.
