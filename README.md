# try-cplusplus

This repository is a personal space for practicing C++ with the help of GitHub Copilot.

## Getting Started

To try out the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Open the repository in GitHub Codespaces.
2. Install GitHub Copilot extension in your Codespace.
3. Install `gh copilot` CLI using [these instructions](https://github.com/github/gh-copilot/#quickstart). This is required for Copilot to work in Codespaces.
4. Open a `.cpp` file and start coding with the help of Copilot.

## Usage

Once you have the repository open in Codespaces and the Copilot extension installed, you can start exploring and practicing C++.

Feel free to modify the existing code or create new C++ files to experiment with different concepts and techniques.

Happy coding!
